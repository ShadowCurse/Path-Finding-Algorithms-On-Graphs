## Path-Finding-Algorithms-On-Graphs
 
This is university project, cteated to practice path finding algorithms on grahps.

This progremm is written in C++ with Qt but bacause it is my first project in Qt it is very unoptimized.
Graph itself is rendered by QGraphicsView class so it's very slow when there are a lot of nodes and edges on the scene.

# Algorithm:
- Dijkstra
- Double Dijkstra
- AStar
- Constractional hierarchy preprocessing with Double Dijkstra
- Arc Flags + Dijkstra

Project itself can be found in GV folder

Pictures of working programm can be found in Pictures folder

Compiled version for Windows can be found in release folder
